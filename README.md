# MongBroke for Tridion
This project's goal is to create an open source Tridion Content Broker that can deploy DD4T deployment packages into a MongoDB database repository. 
It's aim is to create an alternative Content Broker that is both faster and easier to query than the Content Broker that comes out of the box.  

# Why build another Content Broker?
I've been working with the Content Broker ever since I developed my first Tridion projects. First with CWA, and later using XML pushed into the Broker database. 
But what has always been the biggest challenge is that it was never really easy to query content from the Content Broker.
